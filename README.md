# Datasette Geo

**Work in progress. Don't expect this to work yet, especially since it depends on a lot of unmerged Datasette features.**

A plugin to make Spatialite databases work automatically with Datasette.

Planned features:

* Better representation of Spatialite geometries in table views
* Fast, scalable map viewing using Mapbox GL and an integrated Mapbox Vector Tile server
* GeoJSON export endpoints
* Maybe more?
